### 1. SENT BY GitHub Staff

Hi there,

I'm contacting you on behalf of GitHub Support because we've received a DMCA takedown notice regarding the following content:

https://github.com/Jacksgong/Blog

You can view the notice and the details of the requested changes below.

In this case only certain files were identified as allegedly infringing. Since it's not possible to disable individual files within a GitHub repository, we're giving you a 24 hour opportunity to remove the content named in the takedown. Please follow the steps in the following article to remove the content from the history:

https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data

Once you've done that, please reply to this message to confirm the change. If we don't hear from you that a change is made within the next 24 hours, we will need to disable the entire repository according to our GitHub DMCA Takedown Policy, which you can find here:

https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/

If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice, as described on the DMCA Takedown Policy page.

PLEASE NOTE: It is important that you reply within 24 hours to confirm whether you have made the requested changes. If you do not, the repository will be disabled.

### 3. SENT BY Elizabeth (GitHub Support)

Hi Jacks,

Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately, we're not in the position to any additional interpretation of the DMCA takedown notices we receive.

If you decline to make the changes requested in the takedown notice, please know that we will have to disable access to your repository. At that point, you will have the option to either request a second 24-hour window in which to make changes or to file a DMCA counter notice. You can read about both of these options here:

https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/#c-what-if-i-inadvertently-missed-the-window-to-make-changes
https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice/

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,
Elizabeth

### 4. SENT BY ME

Hi GitHub:

Please stop do mistake things with Tencent!

I always like to share knowledge with tech communities, and I always respect for any people originality as I want people to do. I never believe I can receive DMCA takedown notices but I get, I never believe anybody can disable access on my GitHub repo but I get, I never believe the free and open place like GitHub can do such mistake things with Tencent, but you do! YOU LET ME DOWN!

First of all, Yesterday when I receive the DMCA takedown notices, I think there must be some misunderstanding, and I send a DMCA Counter Notice on 'Get help with GitHub to you, but the reply letter is so official, and I think you just ignore my your loyalty user and freedom person request:

![](https://phab.jacksgong.com/file/data/7k3rifznty7xf6oundp2/PHID-FILE-7yakwuzgz6pxsyk7a32u/image.png)

I want you to list all unallowed contents for me, but you didn't, you just sent me one useless official email and after about 10 minutes you disabled public access on [my Blog repo](github.com/Jacksgong/Blog). So helpless and insecure on GitHub for me...

For convenience, I public my back up about this "ILLEGAL REPO" on my own Gitlab: [https://git.jacksgong.com/Jacksgong/blog](https://git.jacksgong.com/Jacksgong/blog) and the "ILLEGAL FILE": [Workflows-Proxy](https://git.jacksgong.com/Jacksgong/blog/blob/fd6bcba4c3dae29128e79233fec4d1b898964bc0/source/_posts/Workflows-Proxy.md) ( which is written on 2014, it is just about Alfred Workflow, Not the Tencent source code!).

#### So I want to know

From the [DMCA notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-08-17-Tencent.md) I even don't know anything about `[private]`  which is Tencent mentioned about unique authentication, could you please list it for me?

If you don't provide it, I have to guess, I search all refer to Tencent on [the post you said leak your unique authentication](https://git.jacksgong.com/Jacksgong/blog/blob/fd6bcba4c3dae29128e79233fec4d1b898964bc0/source/_posts/Workflows-Proxy.md), I found:

```
http://txp-01.tencent.com/proxy.pac
```

#### Is it on the `[private]` content? If real this one, could you please tell why it's illegal?

1. does there any license on this link and I violate?
2. is there any article of law on any country about people can't using some public link( which anybody can access on anywhere )?
3. is GitHub doesn't allow user write some content free on license and law on GitHub? could you please list avoid content or regex?
4. is it any big company want you GitHub to help them avoid any content on GitHub, you just stay on them rather than your user and just do that and ignore any DMCA Counter Notice from the user?

**If there is any answer is yes, or you have some other reason can convince me, please write on letter and list all exactly avoid contents, then I will remove it from my repo, then please recover my repo, thank you.**

Further more, about the link of `http://txp-01.tencent.com/proxy.pac`,  the Tencent public it event on its own website: [whistle--全新的跨平台web调试工具](https://www.qcloud.com/community/article/164816001481011863), and you can find everywhere, like [百度内部也维护一个PAC文件.. - v2ex](https://www.v2ex.com/t/197997). If you search digger you can find there are many companies have such link, and most of them are public, I think if it's public, it is the nice contribute for tech community, If it's private, Tencent also have many ways to hide it with authenticate or whatever, It is a tech-company, not carrion-government but why he oppress the GitHub user?

Please forgive me I recorded all our contact message on my [phabricator](https://phab.jacksgong.com), I really want to know the real side of my favorite community.

Looking forward to your reply.

Finally, hope you respect even one user.
Thank you.

龚振杰. Jacks

Or, if you would like to make changes to the repository in order to have it reinstated, you can request a second 24-hour window to do so:

### 6. SENT BY ME

Hi Github,

Could you please tell me which Copyright I violate with which content?

If you don’t provide it, just disable public access to my repo because of one Tencent unreasonable request.

WHERE IS YOUR DUTY?

You take along with the U.S. Copyright Office’s official website on your doc and push me to delete NO COPYRIGHT, PUBLIC, FREE content, Don’t you think you do tarnish the U.S Copyright?

If you don’t provide it just force me to read tons of document and want me to provide 1,2,3,4,5..etc. info with DMCA Counter Notice, and after that force me to wait 10-14 days for Tencent response, If I win with my tired body, could you please pay for my wasted time?

Hope you provide it in the response email, thank you.
Jacks
